YourPassenger is a mobile app that challenges to solve the problem of texting and driving. It gives drivers a merit score from 0 to 1000 depending on their texting while driving habits. The app uses NFC and a magnetic sensor to accurately detect when the user is texting. His/Her score will change depending on their decisions to leave their phone down while driving.
